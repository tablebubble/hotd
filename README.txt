HOTD is intended to be a linux version of an already existing windows application created by beconvienced.com, but since they discontinued support for the application because it was originally written for windows XP. Since the release of windows vista, the application has failed to work and I also wanted a linux version of the application beacuse i spend most of my time working on the linux platform. So, I decided to write a linux version, but writting a program in Qt will also port to windows without much review so i decided to also make a windows port of application.
